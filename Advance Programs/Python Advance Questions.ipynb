    "\n",
    "## Explanation of the Code:\n",
    "\n",
    "- The code defines a Python decorator named `measure_time` that is used to measure the execution time of a function.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Inside the `measure_time` decorator, there is a nested function called `wrapper`. This `wrapper` function will replace the original function to measure its execution time.\n",
    "\n",
    "- The `wrapper` function takes `*args` and `**kwargs` as its arguments, which allows it to accept any number of positional and keyword arguments that the decorated function may have.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Inside the `wrapper` function:\n",
    "  - It records the start time using `time.time()` before calling the original function.\n",
    "  - It calls the original function using `func(*args, **kwargs)` to execute the actual code.\n",
    "  - It records the end time using `time.time()` after the original function has finished executing.\n",
    "  - It calculates the execution time by subtracting the start time from the end time.\n",
    "\n",
    "- The execution time is then printed to the console using the `print` function, indicating which function was measured and the time taken in seconds, with a precision of two decimal places.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Finally, the `wrapper` function returns the result of the original function, preserving the behavior of the decorated function.\n",
    "\n",
    "- The `@measure_time` decorator is applied to the `Example_function` function using the `@` symbol. This means that when `Example_function` is called, it will be wrapped by the `measure_time` decorator, and its execution time will be measured and printed.\n",
    "\n",
    "- The `Example_function` is a sample function that simulates a time-consuming operation by sleeping for 2 seconds using `time.sleep(2)`.\n",
    "\n",
    "- When `Example_function()` is called, it triggers the decorator, and the decorator measures and prints the execution time of `Example_function`."

    "\n",
    "### Solution:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Diamond Inheritance Problem**:\n",
    "  - The Diamond Inheritance Problem occurs in multiple inheritance when a class inherits from two classes that have a common base class.\n",
    "  - It can lead to ambiguity in method resolution because there are two paths to reach the common base class.\n",
    "  - Python's MRO and C3 Linearization help resolve the Diamond Inheritance Problem by establishing a consistent order for method lookup.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Super() Function**:\n",
    "  - The `super()` function is used to call a method from a parent class in a derived class.\n",
    "  - It plays a crucial role in managing method resolution in cases of multiple inheritance by following the MRO.\n",
    "  - `super()` helps ensure that all inherited methods are invoked correctly, maintaining the integrity of the class hierarchy.\n",
    "  \n",
    "## Explanation of the Code:\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, we have a class hierarchy with multiple inheritance, and we want to determine which `show` method gets called when we invoke it on an instance of class `D`. The Method Resolution Order (MRO) plays a crucial role in determining this behavior. Here's the explanation for both cases:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Case 1: Class D Inherits from B and C (D(B, C))**\n",
    "\n",
    "- `D` inherits from both `B` and `C`. When you create an instance of `D` and call its `show` method, the MRO will determine which `show` method gets called.\n",
    "\n",
    "- The MRO is determined by the C3 linearization algorithm, which preserves the order of inheritance. In this case, the MRO for `D` follows the order: `D -> B -> C -> A`.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Therefore, when you call `d.show()`, it will execute the `show` method of class `B`, and the output will be \"B.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "**Case 2: Class D Inherits from C and B (D(C, B))**\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's consider a slight modification where class `D` inherits from `C` and then `B`. The MRO will change:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "class D(C, B):\n",
    "    pass\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "- In this case, the MRO for `D` follows the order: `D -> C -> B -> A`.\n",
    "\n",
    "- When you call `d.show()`, it will execute the `show` method of class `C`, and the output will be \"C.\"\n",
    "\n",

    "# 5. Metaclasses:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **What is a Metaclass**:\n",
    "  - A metaclass is a class that defines the behavior and structure of other classes, often referred to as \"class factories.\"\n",
    "  - It is like a blueprint for classes, determining how classes themselves should be constructed.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Use Cases**:\n",
    "  - **Customizing Class Creation**:\n",
    "    - Metaclasses can be used to customize the creation of classes. You can define your own logic for how class attributes, methods, and initialization should work.\n",
    "  \n",
    "  - **Validation and Enforcement**:\n",
    "    - Metaclasses allow you to enforce coding standards and constraints on classes. For example, you can ensure that specific methods or attributes are defined in all subclasses.\n",
    "  \n",
    "  - **Singleton Pattern**:\n",
    "    - You can implement the Singleton pattern using a metaclass to ensure that only one instance of a class exists.\n",
    "  \n",
    "  - **ORMs (Object-Relational Mapping)**:\n",
    "    - Metaclasses are used in ORMs like Django's ORM to create Python classes that map to database tables. They generate classes based on database schema.\n",
    "  \n",
    "  - **Plugin Architecture**:\n",
    "    - Metaclasses can facilitate the creation of a plugin system where classes automatically register themselves when they are defined.\n",
    "  \n",
    "- **Creating a Metaclass**:\n",
    "  - To create a metaclass, you define a class that inherits from the built-in `type` class.\n",
    "  - You can override special methods in the metaclass, such as `__new__` and `__init__`, to customize class creation.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Applying a Metaclass**:\n",
    "  - To use a metaclass, you specify it in a class definition using the `metaclass` keyword or by inheriting from a class that has a metaclass.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Caution**:\n",
    "  - Metaclasses can make code more complex and harder to understand if overused. Use them when they provide a clear benefit.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Common Metaclasses**:\n",
    "  - Python has some built-in metaclasses for specific purposes, like `abc.ABCMeta` for creating abstract base classes and `type` for standard class creation.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Dynamic Behavior**:\n",
    "  - Metaclasses can dynamically alter the behavior of classes at the time of creation, allowing for powerful and flexible design patterns in Python.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Advanced Use Cases**:\n",
    "  - In advanced scenarios, metaclasses can be used for code generation, AOP (Aspect-Oriented Programming), and more, making them a powerful tool for Python developers."
