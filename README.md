<centre><h1>About Python Programming</h1></centre>
--> Python is a high-level, general-purpose, and very popular programming language.<br><br>
--> Python programming language (latest Python 3) is being used in web development, Machine Learning applications, along with all cutting-edge technology in Software Industry.<br><br>
--> Python is available across widely used platforms like Windows, Linux, and macOS.<br><br>
--> The biggest strength of Python is huge collection of standard library .<br>

<h1>Modes of Executions</h1>
Python programming language can be executed in the following two modes:
<h2>1. Interactive mode</h2>
<h3>a) Python Shell</h3>
Python Shell is a command line tool that starts up the python interpreter to read a Python statement, 
evaluate the result of that statement and then prints the result on the screen.<br>
<h3>b) IDLE</h3>
In Windows search Type IDLE. It is an acronym of "Integrated DeveLopment Environment".<br>
<h3>c) Anaconda</h3>
Installing Anaconda Software and using Jupyter Notebook.<br>
<h3>d) Google Colab</h3>
Colaboratory, or “Colab” for short, is a product from Google Research which allows anybody to write and execute python code in Jupyter notebook through the browser.<br>

<h2>2. Script mode</h2>
Python programs are written in editors and saved as the file with the .py extension which can be executed further. <br>

<h1>Basic Datatypes</h1>

<h2> Numbers</h2>
✓ Number data type stores numerical values only.<br><br>
--> It is further classified into three different types: <br>
&nbsp   &nbsp &nbsp   a) Int  b) Float  c) Complex
<h2>String</h2>
✓ A string is a group of characters and can include alphabets, digits or special characters including 
spaces.<br><br>
--> We can use single, double, or triple quotes to define a string.
<h2>List</h2>
✓ Lists are used when we need a simple iterable collection of data that may go for frequent modifications.<br><br>
--> For example, if we store the names of students of a class in a list, then it is easy to update the list when 
some new students join or some leave the course.
<h2>Tuple</h2>
✓ Tuples are used when we do not need any change in the data.<br><br>
--> For example, names of months in a year.
<h2>Sets</h2>
✓ Sets are used when we need uniqueness of elements and to avoid duplicacy it is preferable to use sets.<br><br>
--> For example, list of items in a museum.
<h2>Dictionary</h2>
✓ Dictionaries are used if our data is being constantly modified or we need a fast lookup based on a custom 
key or we need a association between the key : value pair.<br><br>
--> For Example, A mobile phone book is a good application of dictionary.

<h1>Libraries Used</h1>
<p>Short Description about all libraries used.</p>
<ul>
<li>NumPy (Numerical Python) – Enables with collection of mathematical functions
to operate on array and matrices. </li>
  <li>Pandas (Panel Data/ Python Data Analysis) - This library is mostly used for analyzing,
cleaning, exploring, and manipulating data.</li>
<li>Matplotlib - It is a data visualization and graphical plotting library.</li>
  
</ul>
